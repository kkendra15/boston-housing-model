Boston Housing Model Evaluation Program 

Program written in System/370 assembly language with the ASSIST assembler which evaluates three given subsets of data from the Boston Housing Market, and then generates predictions and calculates statistics using the data. I worked closely with a classmate, Alexander Betolasi, to complete this project.
